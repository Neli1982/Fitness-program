# FitnessProgram

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically run.

## NoSQL & MongoDB

For this project I have used MongoDB to collect my data. So to see my data you have to open new terminal in server folder and execute "npm start" command. The server will listen on port :4200.

## About app-Fitness-program

This app was created to help users to make fitness-program for themselves. On the first page you can see a list of practises (these are essential practises from my data). You can choose every practise by 'click' on it. This will show you a detail information about the choosen practise. You can also delete, add and update each practise. From the detail information you can go to the exercises information. Which is structured in the same way. So enjoy your tour :) 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
